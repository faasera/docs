# Data Security Practices

Faasera is built from the ground up with enterprise-grade security to protect sensitive data across all workloads,
whether on cloud, hybrid, or on-prem environments.

---

## Encryption Standards

- **In-Transit**: TLS 1.2+ encryption for all API, function, and SDK communication.
- **At-Rest**: Configurable encryption using AES-256 or customer-managed keys (CMK).
- **Column-Level Masking**: Masked values never leave the platform unprotected.

---

## Key Management

- Supports native integration with:
    - AWS KMS
    - Azure Key Vault
    - Google Cloud KMS
- Local KMS abstraction for on-prem deployments.
- Key rotation, revocation, and versioning fully supported.

---

## Authentication & Access Control

- **RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control with fine-grained permissions.
- **SAML / OIDC**: Supports SSO integration with enterprise identity providers.
- **API Key Management**: Token-based auth for external tools and systems.

---

## Auditing & Monitoring

- Every interaction with Faasera (UI/API/Function) is logged.
- Tamper-proof audit logs for compliance review.
- Integration with SIEM tools (Splunk, Elastic, Datadog).

---

## Threat Protection

- Built-in protections against injection, replay, and DoS attacks.
- Secure sandbox execution of user-defined functions (UDFs).
- Rate limiting, IP allowlists, and throttling supported per deployment.

---

## Secure Deployment

- Containerized and serverless-first deployment models.
- Built-in vulnerability scanning and hardened base images.
- Supports infrastructure-as-code security scanning (Terraform, ARM, etc.).

---

## Compliance-Aligned Practices

- Faaseraâ€™s engineering and operational processes align with:
    - SOC 2 Type II (internal controls and monitoring)
    - ISO 27001 (information security management)
    - HIPAA (for healthcare customers)
    - GDPR & CCPA readiness
