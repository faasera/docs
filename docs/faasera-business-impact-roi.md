## 1. 60% Faster Compliance

**Claim:** Auto-detect, mask, and validate data with no manual effort

### Why It Matters:

| Capability                       | Designed Impact                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Built-in AI Profiler**         | Automatically identifies PII/PHI using heuristics and LLM hints — eliminating manual tagging and reducing profiling time by up to 70%. |
| **One-click Policy Execution**   | Enables end-to-end masking and validation pipelines, cutting down setup and configuration time significantly.                          |
| **No Workflow Rewiring Needed**  | Seamlessly integrates into existing tools (Airflow, NiFi, Spark) — no need for pipeline redesign.                                      |
| **Auto-validation & Audit Logs** | Provides built-in validation and audit-ready outputs, reducing manual QA overhead.                                                     |

## 2. 40% Lower Costs

**Claim:** Consolidate tools and avoid vendor lock-in

### Why It Matters:

| Cost Driver                 | Faasera Advantage                                                                                                             |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tool Sprawl**             | Unifies profiling, masking, data generation, validation, risk scoring, and governance — removing the need for multiple tools. |
| **Serverless Architecture** | Eliminates infrastructure maintenance overhead with scalable, usage-based deployment.                                         |
| **FaaS SDKs**               | Avoids per-user or per-record pricing — logic is embedded directly into data pipelines.                                       |
| **Open Integration Layer**  | Compatible with enterprise stacks — reducing cost of integration and avoiding lock-in.                                        |
